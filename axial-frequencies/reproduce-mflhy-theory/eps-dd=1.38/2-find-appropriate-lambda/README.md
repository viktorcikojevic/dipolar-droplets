# Finding the appropriate lambda for the MFLHY theory

I've taken the same code from ../1-equilibrate and modified it to search for <$x^2$> as a function of $\lambda$. The lambda is varied to find a region where $\lambda$ is small enough that the system is in the "linear" regime, where <$x^2$> is linear in $\lambda$. This value should be used as the $\lambda$ for the search of axial frequencies.
