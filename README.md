# Dipolar Droplets

Contains code for the study of Dy dipolar droplets with the combination of QMC and DFT techniques.


# Description of notebooks

- Notebook [derivation_of_variational_energy.ipynb](derivation_of_variational_energy.ipynb) contains the code for the mathematical derivation necessary for the project, using sympy.
- Notebook [critical_atom_number.ipynb](critical_atom_number.ipynb) contains the code for the calculation of the critical atom number for the formation of a dipolar droplet. 

# Description of outputs

- Folder [energies-qmc](energies-qmc) contains the energies of the QMC calculations for the different atom numbers.
- Folder [experimental-data](experimental-data) contains the experimental data for the critical atom number.
- Folder [plots](plots) contains the plots of the project made by the notebooks
